					<p>
						After reading the short about me, I rhink you still won't know much about me. So it would be great if I show you some of my pictures, right?<br>
						<br>
						Unfortunately, I usually take pictures of others or scenery instead of myself. So it would be a "small" album XD

						I love travelling. Actually, most of us should love travelling. Most of my pictures were taken during travelling because they were some of my happiest moment in my life!<br>
						<br>
						Here are some pictures taken when I just went to Phuket after I left my previous company. The only pictures with me is the one at my home page =3=

						I also went to Japan several times this few years. It is a great place. People are very nice, food is delicious. Only that things are a bit expensive. I went to Hokkaido and Osaka. Both are great place to visit.<br>
						<br>
						Beside travelling, I also like swimming and playing badminton. I just don't take pictures during so. If you want to play badminton, please ask me to join together!

						There are also some photos of me in my previous company, GP. It should be most famous for its battery, but I work in its professional audio equipment product line. <br>
						<br>
						If you have heard of <b>KEF</b>, that was where I worked in. It is a good company to work in. The people are nice. Lots of opportunities to learn. The photos was me joining its outing and blood donation.
